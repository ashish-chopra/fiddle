Fiddle 1.0
==============

I have a pool of friends who keep visiting around the globe all around the year!

Fiddle is a web based app to pin their visited locations and share their memorable experiences at one place. It is a work in progress application, and many more features have been thought to introduce into this app.

Current Release
===================
The latest stable release of Fiddle is `v1.0.1`.



Upcoming Features
===================
   1. Feature to pin new locations using Fiddle UI is required. Currently the entry is added into the database which is rendered on the screen upon refresh!! This was the agile approach.
   2. Provide a toggle on the screen to toggle the pins as per the visitor. For e.g. if i want to see Ashish's visited pins, then only those will be visible. For this, i have planned a new approach of clustering algorithms in Machine Learning. The application learns from the data and cluster the posts based on identified visitors in the database. No hard code programming will be given to the computer!
   3. Gradually rolling out an android app based on Material Design principle given in Google IO 2014.


Credits
============
Well this app was a joint effort. Thank you Naseem for completing it. I was involved in design part.

Although, I am artistically challenged. That's why i borrowed icons and images from internet. I thanks Google for creating beautiful icons and images for people with special needs like me!

All credits for graphics to Google!
